## Un-blackboxing AI

In this talk – aided by a visual representation of a mono neuronal cell –  we will uncover the basic concepts of machine learning.

0. The Simple Perceptron
    * Framing the topic { AI [ MACHINE LEARNING ( DEEP LEARNING ) ] } What does what mean.
    * At the beginning I will give a simple explanation of the functions of a single neuron, and how those functions have been translated into algorithms. I will introduce the topic of supervised learning with a visual example. With the aid of this visuals I will introduce the terminology often used in machine learning to describe the prediction (feedforward) and training (backpropagation & gradient descent) of single perceptrons. Those will be explained both on mathematical and algorithmical level. After this I will explain a simple multylayer perceptron and the classification problem.
1. Questioning A.I. as entity (God? Aware Earth?)
