Racism is productive! (Ruha Benjamin)

1. Define looking inward:
   1. what are the practices that enable racism and exploitation within socio-technological infrastructure
2. present the case study: youtube
   1. need to bridge slavery and labour maybe with Bodei and Atanasoski && Vora
   2. reflect its predicting algorithm with the texts from [the view - karin Van Es](../readings/to_read/capitalism-critique/youtube-the-view.pdfd), Yardem Katz, [Thatcher - Data colonialism through accumulation by dispossession: New metaphors for daily data](../readings/to_read/post-colonial-queer/Thatcher-data-colonialism.pdfd), [youtube inequality - Sarah Bishop](../readings/to_read/algorithmic-cultures/to-read/bishop-youtube-inequality.pdfd), [Paper from Jathan Sadowski - When data is capital](../readings/to_read/capitalism-critique/Jathan-Sadowski-When-data-is-capital-Datafication-accumulation-and-extraction.pdfd) and [technical papers on reccomender algorithms](../readings/to_read/AI_technical)
   3. within the Thatcher paper discuss colonialism, exporting private property, labour extracted for free from people as a practice informed from racism, extractivism and manufacture of data refer also to notes on [data manufacture](./03-how-to-make-a-datapoint.md) and the [presentation on data manufacture](./20201202-data-manufacture-and-infinite-scrolling.md)

"Making surrogate = extracting a function (exteriority) from humans and non, while removing/suppressing interiority." from surrogate humanity





Hello and Welcome everyone to the third lecture of the race design and technology series.

I titled this lecture "*looking inward*" the reason why it is titled like this, is to point our gaze toward the other end of race, us.
But who is us? You may ask, and as already discussed in the previous seminar [us]() and [we]() might hide a double meaning hiding gendered and racial oppression. In this case [us]() is referred to both europeans and westerners and to a subjectivity brilliantly explained by Neda Atanasoski and Kalindi Vora in their book "Surrogate Humanity" the [*technoliberal subject*](); that, simply put, is a subject who sees technology as the gateway to human freedom, without acknowledging the gendered and racial exploitation that it hides.
So to clarify this lecture wants to subvert the view, and instead of looking at who is the target of racism I want to look at who uses it in order to justify ideologies of territorial expansion.

Surely this we, this us might not resonate with the views of any of the people listening to this lecture, actually some of you might have experienced oppression from the above mentioned we. Nevertheless, I would like to take you to a short journey to explore how thoughts of important Academics of the 17th and 18th century have granted the moral permission of colonial exploitation, and how such way of thinking is still well and alive within the technology of daily use today.
To do so I will briefly explain the concept of "primitive accumulation" and the racial and gendered myths behind it, and how such ideas have been included in the way some technologies and designs are constructed to extract information.
In the second part of the lecture I will guide you through another journey within the guts of your browser to "*look inward*" again, but this time in the sense that we will look inside your browser when navigating onto a social media platform.

To understand what primitive accumulation is we need to look into the Labor theory of property formulated by John Locke. in his two "treatises on government" Locke, inspired by land grabbing happening in north America, produced a theory that states that labor, therefore cultivation, can turn a natural resource into private property. Therefore, briefly explained, if European come to north America and they cultivate the land, that land becomes property of the Europeans. Since the indigenous people did not cultivate the land they have no right over it. Furthermore in the 18th century the figure of Adam Smith creates another myth around privatisation creating the dichotomy of the lazy and laborious worker, and the natural right of the latter to claim right over land and the right over the means of production, constructed through the wealth he accumulated thanks to his "natural" tendency to be rich.
It is within such frame that indigenous people slowly deprived of the land they inhabited for centuries, need to sell their labor in order to access the means of substinence aka food. And this process of separating a population from their means of production that forms a prehistory of capital, the so called primitive accumulation. It is to be noted that what described here it is a form of primitive accumulation pertinent to territory and culture of a specific epoch. Marx himself acknowledges that forms of primitive accumulation might vary between territories and cultures in time, but it nevertheless creates inequity and exploitation. Another thing to keep in mind here are words of John Locke "whatever I work upon I have the right to own it" and the dichotomy of the lazy and laborious formulated by Adam Smith.

This brings us to the 21st century. How does what described earlier reflect in the current epoch? How can we connect Primitive accumulation with the current data driven economies of tech corporations?

To answer to this question I will try to explore and discuss with you the ways in which data has become the so called oil of the 21st century, and how data driven technologies re-enact this form of primitive accumulation.

The current landscape of critical studies of data driven technology draws a connection between the ways in which users are manipulated into using social media platform the production of data points that are accumulated within the servers of tech companies. Some academics, like Couldry, Thatcher and Paula Ricaurte, refer to it as *data colonialism*, specially in reference to the extractive practice that such companies deploy in order to gather personal information from the users of their platforms. Here I need to make a note as I don't really agree with the term data extraction, because it implies that data exist in a raw natural form, but data if anything is neither natural nor raw. This because data is always created at the interaction between user and platform; therefore data, in my opinion, rather than extracted is manufactured.
To explain this better I will cite a couple of sources starting from Sandro Mezzadra, who building upon concepts of Kalindi vora states:

> As Vora has recently shown, this opening of the human body as a site for annexation, harvest, and production has strong resonances and continuities with land plundering and natural resource dispossession under European territorial colonialism

On a same note Jim Thatcher, David O'Sullivan and Dillon Mahmoudi say

> Big data is a colonial policy, but it is one in which, rather than opening the idealized markets of digital frontierismâ€™s problematic imaginary, we have become subject to them. Sensors quantify, alienate, and extract conceptions of self, reducing life as seen by capital to what can be recorded and exchanged as digital data. Linked together in aggregate, the sum total of data produced by an individual marks them into an abstracted bucket, a digital commodity that may be continually bought and sold in order to call forth an orderly, predictable stream of consumption

In both of their texts the authors refer on how forms of primitive accumulation play a role in the re-enactment of colonial practices in order to accumulate data. The authors are aware of how Marx described primitive accumulation, and as stated earlier, primitive accumulation happens when a population is separated by their means of production. But what are the means of production in the case of social media users, and how are they separated from the users?
To answer this question we need to grasp what I previously mentioned as data manufacture and how the latter is made proprietary by the social media platform owners.
Maybe the best way to show you how data is manufactured is to literally manufacture some

[here you show how to use the network debugging tool to observe what leaves the computer in form of a data point]

This is how information is manufactured within youtube. And despite this being a one way communication, I can hear in the back of my mind you listeners telling me: but yann every time you sign up for such a service you sign an End Of User Licence Agreement that clearly states that the social media platform will get some of your data and sell it to advertising, blah blah blah... to wich I respond by citing this brilliant quote by Paula Ricaurte

# refusing to generate data means exclusion

Look at the current situation also in this class, the way I deliver you this lecture, the infrastructure of "windows teams" is proprietary, and if you don't agree with microsoft data policies than you can't access the platform, therefore exclusion from the class.

After this detour we should get back to the question posed earlier: how are the means of production separated from the social media users, in order to reproduce primitive accumulation by big tech companies?

Data manufacture as shown before is so deeply hidden and alienated from the user that he barely knows that he participates in the manufacture of data, de facto detaching him from what he produces. to the point that the user does not even know what he produces. therefore if I was to use the word extraction, I would not say that data is extracted, but rather it is free labour, in the form of data manufacture, that is extracted by social media users.
To relate back to Lockian "labour theory of property" it is easy to imagine how social media company see the users behaviors as land or territory rich of raw data to be claimed proprietary by harvesting it. And I know this may sound confusing and contradictory, is it manufacture, extraction or harvest? In my opinion none and all of this words are correct, what i'm trying to present here is how this old way of thinking that nature is there to be turned into profit, whether it is "inferior" human bodies, materials or online behaviours, is still very much alive within the ways in which data-driven technologies operate nowadays. To make it short the modes by which this "extraction/harvest/manufacture" happens have changed but the motives are the same. From my perspective data is rather manufactured, but the narratives that circulate within the data-driven technology are of another idea, that is more aligned with the lockian labour theory of property, in which the world is just a big amount of data to be analysed and the process of analysis similar to the harvesting of land in the colonial times turns the data into a private property to be sold in the advertising market.

The purely white ideologies of the enlightenment liberals are still very alive within the ideas and motives of techno-liberal subject, and while the former where enacted on more savage an violent way the current practice of primitve accumulation is rendered almost invisible and non violent toward the direct users, but the socio economical reverberation of such practices are very violent indeed widening and expanding inequity within the classes already targeted by racial colonialism in the past.

I don't want here to compare the struggles of the people suffering from racism with what happens within the manufacture of data, but rather to show how both of them are appear by the same motives of capital accumulation, to re use the quote from Ruha Benjamin "Racism is productive", indeed, its roots lay in the modes by which white european imperialists[???] have re-constructed the world around them.
