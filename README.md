My teaching emphasizes a thoughtful and critical engagement with technology, while also providing students with the technical skills they need to work with it.
With a focus on care, justice, and ethical responsibility, my approach encourages students to consider the social impact of digital tools and the ways technology can be shaped to support collective well-being.
