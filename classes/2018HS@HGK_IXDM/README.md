# Aesthetic Responsibility, Self-Design and Coding



> _Indeed, design‚Äîincluding self-design‚Äîis primarily a mechanism for inducing suspicion. The contemporary world of total design is often described as a world of total seduction from which the __unpleasantness of reality has disappeared.__ But I would argue, rather, that the world of total design is a world of total suspicion, a world of latent danger lurking behind designed surfaces. The main goal of self-design then becomes one of neutralizing the suspicion of a possible spectator, of creating the sincerity effect that provokes trust in the spectator‚Äôs soul. In today‚Äôs world, the production of sincerity and trust has become everyone‚Äôs occupation‚Äîand yet it was, and still is, the main occupation of art throughout the whole history of modernity: the modern artist has always positioned himself or herself as the only honest person in a world of hypocrisy and corruption._

## Learning Outputs

* Critical thinking toward _self-design_ using creative coding as a tool
* Making the invisible daily generated data visible through creative coding

## Schedule

### 24.09 Hello C[omputer]V[ision]!

In this first class we will look at computer vision software and how it is used for facial recognition. How can we fool such algorithms in a way that they can't recognize faces anymore? We will look at the examples of [Adam Harvey ](https://ahprojects.com/) and his [CV Dazzle](https://cvdazzle.com/) and we will test the limits of such algorithm by trying different makeup techniques. _On the other hand we will also try to fool the algorithm by drawing faces by hand (to be decided yet)_.

### 01.10 / 08.10 Hello p5.js!

This second part of the course will be concentrated in developing the basic skills of coding using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). This JavaScript library builds on [Processing](https://processing.org/) a coding framework for generative design.

JavaScript is the most used scripting language for the web. By learning this tool you will be able to design simple interactive websites.

__Dependencies a.k.a. what you need to download__

  * add extensions: live-server

__01.10:__

In this first lesson I will introduce p5.js and how to use it to draw on HTML5 canvas

    rect(x, y, width, height);
    // drawing circle
    ellipse(x, y, width, height);
    // drawing a free form defining the single vertices
    beginShape();
    vertex(x, y); // you can add as many vertices as you like
    endShape(x, y);
    
    // loops!
    for(start, end, increment){
        // repeat something
    }
    
    // if statement
    if(statement == true){
        // do something
    }else{
        // do something else
    }
}
```



__08.10:__

In this lesson we will look at interaction between DOM elements and javascript

```javascript
let element = document.getElementById('id-name')
element.addEventListener('onclick', doSomething);

function doSomething(){
    // something happens
}

```



 

### 15.10 Hello Device Motion!

 /* VARS */

 /* ONDEVICEMOTION */
 // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/devicemotion

     /* RAW VALUES */
     rx = event.accelerationIncludingGravity.x;
     ry = event.accelerationIncludingGravity.y;
     rz = event.accelerationIncludingGravity.z;

     /* SMOOTHED VALUES */
     sx = smoothVal(rx, sx);
     sy = smoothVal(ry, sy);
     sz = smoothVal(rz, sz);
 };

 /* VALUE MAPPING */
 function mapVal(value, istart, istop, ostart, ostop) {
     return ostart + (ostop - ostart) * ((value - istart) / (istop - istart));
 }

 /* VALUE SMOOTHING */
 function smoothVal(inputVal, outputVal) {
     let tarVal = inputVal;
     let calcVal = tarVal - outputVal;
     outputVal += calcVal * easing;
     return outputVal;
 }
```
