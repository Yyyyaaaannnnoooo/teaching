## Video

I the wake of our discussions about what to make public, today I will repackage what I wrote for my first chapter so far, that is not much. The aim is not really to get some feedback, but I hope to maybe have a discussion afterwards.

As a start I would like for us to watch this 2 videos, and let them sink in.

#### 1.1.1 Google nudge management and its reverberation on the platform, or the other way around

In January 2020 I was preparing a class for bachelor students called "Cooking Capitalism". The aim of the Seminar was to discuss the relationship between machinery, capital and workers, true the analysis of the process of making pasta. In each class the students where tasked to find strategies to automate the making of pasta. Unfortunately we never got to automate anything as COVID 19 forced us all into remote teaching. Moreover we had also to skip a class in which we would discuss the management of the workers, and how it has been restructured within the contemporary neoliberal society. For the class I prepared some excerpts from a *point of view* article titled  *"Nudge management: applying behavioural science to increase knowledge worker productivity"* authored by Philip Ebert and Wolfgang Freibichler; as the title implies it describes some case studies of the application of behavioural science in the workplace, which is termed *nudge management*.

Without too much surprise it describes Google, or Alphabet?, as one of the many companies nudging their employee:

> The management system at Google controls the choice architecture of its employees: through simple nudges and resetting of default rules the productivity, decision-making, and perceived freedom of its knowledge workers is improved. [...] So called “micro kitchens” were introduced by Google to increase knowledge transfer amongst knowledge workers in an easy and pleasant way. Workers from different departments meet in the company restaurants and coffee corners. @ebert2017  pg. 2|4

Additional to that in the same text the authors discusses how the choice of healthy food in the cafeteria is made in order to foster productivity, google employees are also offered with a gym and other sport infrastructure to promote health.
And while such choices made by google can be understood as prioritizing the wellbeing of their employees, the fact that it is simply a new form of management tells us what the real priorities are: productivity. But despite the allure of such benefit some employees can see through this smokescreen and recognize the fact that this kind of management creates an environment where work and everyday life gets mixed up ( @fuchs2014 pg.224 ) making them spend more time in the office as their contractual due, de facto extracting more labour than agreed.
If we were to forget that this is a real world case and would translate such approach to the realm of the platforms that the company develops, nudging in this case would be called from a critical standpoint entrapment.
The aforementioned term is used by Nick Seaver to describe the captivating nature of recommender algorithms. In his article "*Captivating algorithms: Recommender systems as traps*" he describes the turn that recommendation system took from the genesis of the *World Wide Web*. Initially big catalogs of titles i.e. books, movies etc. would use recommender algorithms who would score their performance with RMSE (root mean square error) applied to how users would score the accuracy of the recommendation. ( @seaver2019 pg. 8 ) This meant that the recommender system was directly scored by the users, allowing the programmers to adjust it according to such measurement. In the article the author uses Netflix as a case study for the recommendation software, and they trace the shift in what recommender should do according to the shift the company did from DVD lending to streaming service. Therefore from the need to show user the title of the DVD they would like to watch to "*keep users streaming retaining them as paying subscribers*" ( @seaver2019 pg. 8 ); the shift from predicting futures to measuring *'engagement'*. It is the latter that by congregating data about user behavior on the platform would inform the platform owner whether the prediction was accurate. If the user stays this means the prediction was correct.

> In the contemporary software industry, captivation metrics are key indicators of a company’s health and growth (Graham, 2012). These metrics are so important to startups and their venture capitalist investors that they are often prominently displayed on dashboard screens in offices, like an echocardiogram in a hospital room. ( @seaver2019 pg. 11 )

The key take here is the rise of the concept of 'engagement' as the measure of predictive quality. And not because it reflects whether or not the prediction was accurate, but only because it measures quantitatively the time users spend on the platform, making the latter the place for Venture Capitalists investment or not.

I hope that this two examples between online entrapment also known as User Experience and the working conditions at a major tech company offer a view of how human behaviors are exploited for financial gains within tech companies. But not only as direct employees; but also as the user of their softwares.

I want know to focus back on the second video we saw, the one about climbing.
Differently to the first one produced by the company itself to promote their working conditions, the video about the climbing gym gains new meaning in the wake of what I just discussed about. 
First and foremost the climbing gym in this case reflects in a physical form the captivating technology that google uses to trap their platform users. The climbing wall becomes the space that enables overwork and knowledge extraction among workers. while one could argue that this is no different than employees having a beer after work, the fact that it happens within the premises of the company changes the dynamics drastically. The basic freedom of expression that an employee is granted outside the walls of the company vanishes under authoritarian corporate regime, making interactions between employee always available and accountable in future scrutiny. Therefore creating and atmosphere of constant reinforced production.
In the case of the climbers what becomes emblematic is that not only they are trapped within google to perform additional social work, but they also produce creative content that is later uploaded to their platform, that as described already many times creates a domino effect of rabbit holes and filter bubbles, or generally said user entrapment. The video is about entrapment while creating even more entrapment.
