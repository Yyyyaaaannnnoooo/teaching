# HaPoC.002 | Input Theory of Data Fictions

There is a recurring saying among laptops connected to YouTube Servers:

```javascript
l = qj('minimum_duration_to_consider_mouseover_as_hover', 500),
m = qj('max_duration_to_consider_mouseover_as_hover', 600000);
```

That translated into human lingo it says: `It is engagement only up to 10 minutes`

The process of building AI systems requires acquiring enormous amounts of data. However, how this data is acquired within platforms is often opaque. As shown in the code above, some interactions are reduced to simplistic binary logic.

During this two-day workshop, the class will be introduced to the basics of coding through the lens of keyboard and mouse interactions. Students will learn JavaScript and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a beginner-friendly coding environment that transforms webpages into spaces for experimental interactions.

Beyond learning basic coding skills, the goal is to develop a "data fiction" about the data that can be retrieved through interactions with the machine. This will be explored through group projects in the form of websites, reflecting the reductive nature of discretizing interactions into binary operations.
