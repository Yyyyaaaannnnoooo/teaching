# Making Sound with Critical Debugging



## Kurzbeschreibung und Leitidee

The past years of technological development has seen a growing distrust in the tools that are used in everyday life. The commodification of human attention in advertising revenue is going under more attentive scrutiny from governments around the world.
The general awareness of this technological failures, and their false promises have been brought forward, not only by academics but also artists and designers who challenge the technological given, by exerting their right to critique.
Critique in this case and for the purpose of this teaching format is intended as a bottom-up action to question what is given i.e. "normal", accepted or imposed by society at large.

For this CoCreate module the class will explore the possibility of analyzing what happens behind the interface of a website, with browser built in debugging tools. With the sonification of such processes the class will be able to bypass the obfuscation of the interface and make tangible the hidden functionings of websites.

## Lerninhalte

This teaching format will be structured as week-long experimental practice module.
The key objectives of the class will be

* Raise awareness of the extractive practices at play within the Social Media websites ecosystems, with special regard to what happens on the computer of the users
* Introduce the class to debugging software and how to use it for the analysis of how website work in the background
* Introduction of the development of web extensions to interact with the debugging tools
* Introducing the class to the concept of sonification and sound design as an additional element o be used in the creative context

To reach the aforementioned objectives the module will be comprised of different teaching methods. To discuss the data extractive practices the class will watch a movie (tba) and have a discussion afterward facilitated by the class coordinator.
The teaching of the technical skills of programming and debugging will be held as frontal class, where the class will be introduced to the various coding techniques. Given the experimental nature of such class the attendees will be encouraged to work in group so that each member of the group will concentrate to a single objective, this will allow the possibility of grouping of students with different coding skills to work together for the final presentation. For the final presentation the groups will show a functioning "browser sonification", and the concept behind it.

## Kompetenzen

The module will give the students the possibility to achieve several competences.
On technical level the class aims at fostering and expanding coding skills beyond web design. With the introduction to web extension development the attendees will gain knowledge in working with another technology, but with the tools that they might have already learned in other classes. Since web extension are also programmed with JavaScript, attendees who already had introduction to web design will find the syntax familiar. Furthermore, debugging tools is also a technology used in web design, but in this case the class will use additional features of it specifically networking tools and stack tracing. This will give the attendees additional resources that can also be used in web design. Additional to that the class will also engage with sonification and sound design. Such competences will give the students an additional creative tool to add to their repertoire, that goes beyond the visual literacy.
Given the nature of the CoCreate module in which students from different degree programmes join together for a week long class, the goal of this class will be to foster interdisciplinary group projects, that will enable students with different skillsets to work together toward a common goal.
