# Making Argument with Data



What makes these patterns observable? With the project Making Arguments with Datawepropose to develop a learning tool, data observatorythat enables students to engage with digital information in a critical manner. We will use the data obser-vatoryto practice and teach ethics of working with large datasets and designing data represen-tations, as well as to pose wider questions of gender and inclusion.We gained relevant experi-ence in the recently completed SNSF-funded research project Negentropic Explorations of Radio. We programmed and used web-based interfaces to explore a community-ranarchive of ra-dio signals. Inspired by feminist critique of technoscience and recent problematizations of digital literacy, we argued that one can navigate a digital archive in a multi-narrative way. With the Lehrfonds project we propose to develop a teaching strategy based on an accessible tool for practice and critique of datafication and ‘correlationism’ from within. Through teaching formats that enable active engagement with a dataset of a student’s choice, exchange with guest lectur-ers and outreach to teachers at the HGK, the participants in the project will acquire confidence in making arguments with data.
