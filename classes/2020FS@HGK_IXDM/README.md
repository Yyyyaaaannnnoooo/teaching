# Let’s Cook Capitalism | Techno-Politics of Automation
> Let’s Cook Capitalism is a six-times three-hours course about the political economy and techno-politics of optimization and exploitation by automation in our age of digital neoliberalism. In the course you will learn basic insights about the techno-politics of automation and digital exploitation through a mixture of self-experiments and reading exercises. We will practically inquire how body movements and gestures were measured for optimization by cooking a delicious (vegetarian) pasta meal together. Therefore the course takes place in our FoodCultureLab.

> The first topic will be so-called Taylorism from the 1910s. By a video analysis of our cooking we will try to improve the algorithm – our pasta recipe – of the meal. By doing that we will not only learn a bit about programming and coding, but also about the political economy of programmed processes and automation, especially their relationship with labour (physical, but also cognitive work). In the next sessions we will continuously try to optimize our cooking (by looking at distributed processing and aspects of modern logistics), but also read and discuss important critical theories, which allow us to reflect our addiction and dependence to programmed technology and give us hints on how we could change that.

## Objectives of the class
To make short historical analysis of the relationship between labour, autonomy and technology, through the practice of cooking. The class will start from the early concept of division of labour, described by Lorraine Daston, and will end with new forms of labour that emerged from the advent of computation. Each class will be divided into two sections: in the first half reading and critique of a text, and in the second half a practical exercise that enact some of contents already discussed in the text. The class will provide historical references and examples on how labour and technology are entangled, and how discoveries from different scientific fields have shaped the way workers are “managed” to obtain the objective of total efficiency.

## Topics
* [ ] Division of Labour

* [ ] Taylorism && Digital Taylorism and Nudge Management (critic to that theory)

* [ ] Automation && Heteromation (examples of the gig economy from amazon mechanical turk, to uber eats and facebook censors in the philippines)

## Sessions
### Cooking and Manual Labour | age of bodies
-------------------------------------------
Can we see intelligence when applying the rules of division of labour to a simple dish of pasta?

First groups formations to accelerate production

### Food and Technology / Machines | age of machines
-------------------------------------------
Maybe in this class the student are tasked to engineer machines that increase productivity, we could ask the metal/wood workshop than to produce such tools? Or we could ask the student to build tools out of the material from the kitchen.
### 9.3
* __Text:__ [Marx - Fragment on Machines](http://thenewobjectivity.com/pdf/marx.pdf) 

* __Activity:__ Pasta | Introduction of “machinic” utensils

### 16.3
* __Text:__ 

* __Activity:__ 
-------------------------------------------
### Food and Automation/Heteromation | age of information
-------------------------------------------
In this last part there should be a reflection between food and gig economy and how algorithmic platforms like deliveroo or uber eats exploit labour force, while at the same time aggregating information about their users and workers.
