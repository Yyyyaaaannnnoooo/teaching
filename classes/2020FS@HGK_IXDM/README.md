# Let’s Cook Capitalism | Techno-Politics of Automation

> Let’s Cook Capitalism is a six-times three-hours course about the political economy and techno-politics of optimization and exploitation by automation in our age of digital neoliberalism. In the course you will learn basic insights about the techno-politics of automation and digital exploitation through a mixture of self-experiments and reading exercises. We will practically inquire how body movements and gestures were measured for optimization by cooking a delicious (vegetarian) pasta meal together. Therefore the course takes place in our FoodCultureLab.

> The first topic will be so-called Taylorism from the 1910s. By a video analysis of our cooking we will try to improve the algorithm – our pasta recipe – of the meal. By doing that we will not only learn a bit about programming and coding, but also about the political economy of programmed processes and automation, especially their relationship with labour (physical, but also cognitive work). In the next sessions we will continuously try to optimize our cooking (by looking at distributed processing and aspects of modern logistics), but also read and discuss important critical theories, which allow us to reflect our addiction and dependence to programmed technology and give us hints on how we could change that.

## Objectives of the class
To make short historical analysis of the relationship between labour, autonomy and technology, through the practice of cooking. The class will start from the early concept of division of labour, described by Lorraine Daston, and will end with new forms of labour that emerged from the advent of computation. Each class will be divided into two sections: in the first half reading and critique of a text, and in the second half a practical exercise that enact some of contents already discussed in the text. The class will provide historical references and examples on how labour and technology are entangled, and how discoveries from different scientific fields have shaped the way workers are “managed” to obtain the objective of total efficiency.

## Topics

* [ ] Division of Labour

* [ ] Taylorism && Digital Taylorism and Nudge Management (critic to that theory)

* [ ] Automation && Heteromation (examples of the gig economy from amazon mechanical turk, to uber eats and facebook censors in the philippines)

## __Sessions__

> How many of you have been working? How many of you were extremely happy of that experience that they did not wanted to leave the job? How many of you thought "how can this job be better for me"?

- 50gr semola
- 50gr wheat flour
- 50gr water
- 1 table spoon olive oil
```

## Cooking and Manual Labour | age of bodies

-------------------------------------------

`Which parts of the body do we need to produce a plate of pasta? How can I re-arrange bodies in way that making pasta becomes more efficient? How does this in turn reflect on the worker?`

### 17.2

* __Text:__ [Lorraine Daston – Calculation and Division of Labour]()

* __Activity:__ handmade “Cavatelli” with bought tomato sauce making own 100gr of pasta | students here should analyze the production of pasta, making notes or taking pictures or video. The material will be then used in the next class to improve the workflow.

* __Activity:__
Handmade “Cavatelli” with bought tomato sauce. In this class we will re-think the production of past according to the principles of division of labour. What are the main components in the production of pasta? | First groups formations to accelerate production and developing tha algorithm for cavatelli production

## Cooking and Technology | age of machines

-------------------------------------------
Maybe in this class the student are tasked to engineer machines that increase productivity, we could ask the metal/wood workshop than to produce such tools? Or we could ask the student to build tools out of the material from the kitchen.

`In this session we will question the relationship between technology, in the form of machines, and work. How can machines increase productivity? How does this reflect in turn to the worker? How does it reflect on the company? And what about consumism? Here we should reflect on growth and how machines anable the cavatelli company to grow in a conglomerate that produces more than only pasta with tomato sauce. What could the same machine that produces pasta produce? maybe some sweets? And therefore how do we build a machine that is general enough to produce more than pasta? What to do with the overproduction?`

## Cooking and Automation/Heteromation | age of information

-------------------------------------------
In this last part there should be a reflection between food and gig economy and how algorithmic platforms like deliveroo or uber eats exploit labour force, while at the same time aggregating information about their users and workers.

[in this part the students won't make pasta anymore, here they should reflect on how information may in turn transform this dish of pasta in any other commodity linked to food: it could perhaps become pre-cooked dish, or a fitness abo]
