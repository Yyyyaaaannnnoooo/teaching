## Un-blackboxing AI

0. The beginning a.k.a. the Simple Perceptron

   * Framing the topic ( AI ( MACHINE LEARNING ( DEEP LEARNING ) ) ) What does what mean.


   * At the beginning I will give a simple explanation of the functions of a single neuron, and how those functions have been translated into algorithms. I will introduce the topic of supervised learning with a visual example. With the aid of this visuals I will introduce the terminology often used in machine learning to describe the prediction (feedforward) and training (backpropagation & gradient descent) of single perceptron. After this I will explain a simple multylayer perceptron and the XOR problem
