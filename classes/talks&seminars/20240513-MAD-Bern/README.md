# The Future is Magical Programming Paradigm

In my talk I will explore the many ways in which magic and dominant forms of AI entangle with one another. The starting point of the discussion will be an artwork that I developed 6 years ago, the Fisiognomic Horoscope, a device that could assess someone's horoscope sign based on face landmarks detection. From there the discussion will look at machine learning as a predictive tool to look into the future, based on past data. Furthermore the talk will look at the ways in which AI has come to shape what "Future" is, oftentimes resembling to Christian afterlife, as in AI Doomerism or AI Utopia. The talk will end with the proposal of a counter strategies that also employ alternative magic tricks.

Demonstration of this is the appropriation of sciamanic rituals of indigenous people into microdosing to enhance concentration, so that we can continue to work 8~12 hours a day. Or forms of eugenics in virtue of avoiding babies with disabilities, instead of rethinking cities and work to accomodate disability.

## 0. **INTRO**

Ciao a tutti.
Today in my talk I explore the concept of the future as something that can be designed from the present, or better said how it can be expressed as an algorithm to predict the best outcomes for humanity. Thus becoming a magical practice, so to say like looking into the crystal ball 🔮.

I will start from a project I did back in 2017, in which I was mixing magic practices with AI, to than explore various ideologies that are bundled up in the TESCREAL acronym. I will conclude by offering a way to summon a spirit that might help in reconseidering our relationship to technology.

   

## 1. **The Fisiognomic Horoscope**

The fisiognomic horoscope was a project I did back in 2017 for the Internet Yami-Ichi that took place at the Haus der Elektronische Künste in basel.
Back them I started to read and show interest towards the development of AI specially face recognition systems. In those years two very fringe and cringe systesm were developed, one of them was developed in the US, the Gaydar, the other one was developed in china to recognize criminal by face features. The Gaydar was a facial recognition system developed to detect whether a person is homosexual or not. Beside the fact that the results of such a system were comparable to a random guess. The main question remains: what for? What is the reason to develop such a technology?
Similarly in China another facial recognition model was developed to "discriminate between criminals and non criminals". So to say a technological re-interpretation of physiognomy. For those who do not know what physiognomy is,  it was the practice to asses someone's character by their appearence especially their facial traits. This was used specially during the XIX and XX century to asses whether someone would be a criminal or not. and such form of pseudoscience was used to justify racism and ableism.
I was therefore quite terrified by how AI systems were used to reproduce racism, ableism and homophobia, without even questioning such aspects.
My approach to such question was to build a similar machine myself, but rather than identiying sexual orientation or character I decided that having a machine that would define someone's horoscope would be a good starting point for a discussion about the shortcomings of AI systems.
The machine that I built for the Internet Yami-Ichi was trained with images of known actors, and here I must admit I am culpable of data theft, and their zodiac sign. Now I hope this must already suggest all of you that trying to make such correlation would only output arbitrary results, total entropy, randomness. Because assuming that the day of birth might shape the way your face develops is completely absurd. But of course this was the whole point of the artwork: a face has no meaning per se.
Therefore, during the event people would let the machine take a picture of them, and the AI system would predict their Astrological sign, and 99% of the time was wrong. And to be honest some people were also pissed that it was not working correctly, and this would start a conversation between me and the user, where I would explain them why it should not work, and why we should refuse such systems in the first place.

In this isntance I found myself practicing some crappy AI magic, what the system I built was doing, was to do predictions based on data from the past.
And this is how AI systems work, it is nothing else than statistical analysis of large data sets, in order to recognize patterns, and therefore make predictions. Therefore, facial recognition should be rtaher termed facial prediciton, because what machine learning algorithms return is not certainty, but rather the percentage of accuracy, that in some cases is close to 100%, like in the case of digit recognition, but also below 60% in the case of the gaydar. 
What I want to focus here is the term prediction, and how it relates to the idea of the future, but also how it relates to magic, as in predicting the future. Specially how damaging those predicitons are because they are based on data from the past, specially when the past is synonimous with racism, ableism and homophobia, to highlight few of the many biases that are incorporated in datasets.

## 2. White Magic and the future

If there is an agreement to create a parallel between technology and magic based on the idea of predicitons as a magical praxis, when zooming out and looking at technology at large, as discussed in popular culture, magic and technology, also intertwine. To borrow the words of Joel Dinerstein from his paper "Technology and Its Discontents: On the Verge of the Posthuman"

> The massive social transformations brought on by telegraph, railroad, and electricity created a sense that technology was "white magic"

And here the use of the word "white", is not a reference to fantasy fiction, but rather the racial implications it has. The author has more to say about this in the following paragraph:

> nearly all Euro-American "foundational narratives" of nineteenth-century frontier settlement understood their right to the land, not as the New Jerusalem of the Puritans, but "as the technological transformation of an untouched space." Whether by the axe, the mill, the canal, the steamboat, the railroad, the dam, or the steel plow, the technology "caused" a chain of events, allowing the settlers to participate in what they called a "second creation." The white settlers legitimated their presence from New England to California by putting forth the technology as the agent that conquered the wilderness, thus eviscerating Native American (i.e., "first creation") claims to the land, and giving the United States nothing less than "a national myth of origin.

Such ideology spawned from the mind of John Locke, who coined the *Labour Theory  of Property*, a god given right to white men to transform the so called untouched land trough technological means, and turn it into property. And it is not a case that such kind of ideology appears during the first waves of naval colonialism. Finally settlers have the moral and philosophical justification to dispossess indegenous community of their land.
And it is very important here to emphasise the role of technology in the transformation of land into property. Not only the technology in itself, but also the concept that the settlers bring technology, and that the "uneducated" indigenous community do not comprehend such marvels, and thus their technological knowledge does not count as Technology, under the gaze of the settler. So to say, Settlers technology is superior to the technology of the colonised, and therefore should be adopted in order to bring "progress".

[[

~~Here you could insert some referernce to the current situation in Palestine how AI technology is used, but also how the following ideologies help settler colonialism embrace the annihilation of o population for a brighter future for all~~

]]

Of course such a discourse could be expanded, but for the sake of this lecture I would like to focus this idea of ideology and technology as form of "white magic". And specifically to look how this bundle enfolds today, not only for the dipossession of indigenous land or the colonization of outer space, but also to colonize time; more specifically the future.
In order to describe this it is worth to look into the work of Timinth Gebru and Emile P. Torres, who together have coined the acronym TESCREAL, that stands for:

* Transhumanism
* Extropianism
* Singularitarianism
* Cosmism
* Rationalism
* Effective Altruism
* Longtermism

Some of those terms might be familiar to you, but is nevertheless worth to explain some of them, not all of them, I'll take the most interesting.

### Transhumanism

Transhumanism in a nutshell is the philosophy of merging the human body with technology. Some authors would argue that we are already transhuman, as we already use technology, such as coclear implants and pacemaker, to assist disbled and ill people to live longer. And while such intervention show how technology can be used for social good, transhumanist philosophy does not stop there, it aims at the human enhancement towards a superior post-human species, therefore implying that "*some forms of consciousness and modes of experience as inherently more valuable than others*" aka eugenics, or white "liberal eugenics". In this case the superior consciousness is a constructed one that needs to be freed from the human flesh and its cognitive limitations. So to say to reach the potential of *Superintelligence*, therefore, deeming anything that does not fit the racist measure of high IQ as disposable.
Furthermore, such views of the superintelligent post-human always project such endeavor as a result of the work we put now for the future, allowing research in such eugenic laden fields for the betterment of the future.

### Sigularitarianism

This is my favorite ideology and also my starting point of investigation in the topic I am presenting to you. And this interest was sparked form the project I presented you before about the Phisiognomic Horoscope, as when I started to research AI, the term singularity and its ideology started to trigger my interest.
In simple words Sigulatitarinist await the moment in which technology, specifically AI will be so developed, that it would be able to rewrite, and enheance itself. So to say a form of technological recursion, where artificial intelligence would explode into Artificial General Intelligence. Such scenario in this ideology might lead to either complete doom, like the Matrix or Terminator, or into a benevolent sort of AI god who will help humankind with compassion.
Probably some of you are rolling their eyes specially if they grew up in a spiritual household. Such ideas remind very much the ways in which crisitianity describes the final days of humanity in which Jesus Christ will come and judge us into hell or heaven.

### Effective Altruism

If any of you were following the saga of the downfall of FTX, the crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman Fried, you might have also heard the term effective altruism. the latter is quite an interesting ideology, it s is based on a the very noble principle altruism, to donate wealth that is in excess to the less fortunate, nevertheless, it distortes temporality and space in a way that it turns it into a bizarre way to justify wealth accumulation. The whole idea basically wants to supercharge altruism with effectiveness, and what does that mean exactly. Well, the effectiveness in this case can be thought as a sort of algorithm or calculation, by wich one should measure the effect of their own altruism. Therefore before donating to a charity, that is important to you, or also geographically close to you, the choice of your altruism should be guided by maximizing its effectiveness in the future. So instead of disaster relief funds, you should maybe to foundations for the development of schools. And of course seen from a utilitarian and pragmatic point of view this makes sense somehow, but nevertheless, such philosophy argues that there is a correct way to donate, and the correct way is by maximizing the effectiveness in the future.
But the core principle of such philosophy is that instead of, for example devote your life to work for a charity on a low salary, everyone should aim to work for example for a big petro-chemical company, so that you would have more disposable income to donate to the right charity to maximise positive outcomes for the future.

### Longtermism

Longtermism could be described as Effective Altruism on steroids. But rather than focusing on the way that disposable income should be used for projects that will assure a better future, Longtermism as a philosophy takes a more grim turn. Again the premises of this thought start from a noble point of view: we should develop technology that will ensure that the next generations will live in a better society than the one we live now. Like for example when you develop an AI system that targets civilian households to dismantle terrorist groups. The grim turn of longtermist philosophy is that rather than looking to the let's call it near future, so to say the next 100 years, they're concerned with the far distant future, like hundred of thounsds of years from now. Therefore, in their view, if for example climate change actions would put a halt on technological development, specially AI systems, or Crypto that are energy hungry infrastructures, this would hinder the development of a post-human race and therefore it is counted as negative impact. Here I do not want to necessarily place Longtermist together with Climate Denial Activists, I just want to highlight that for longtermists the extiction of part of the world population in the next few hundreds year would not be a problem if such a scenrio would entail an utopian future in year 1.000.000. To steal the words of Nese Devenot:

> Longtermism is an extension of the extractive logics that Williams and Brant characterize as “anti-life.” Drawing on Achille Mbembe’s concept of necropolitics or “the subjugation of life to the power of death,” they reveal how the colonial project is premised on a (white supremacist) human exceptionalism that assumes the right to label some life as disposable, and hence to identify acceptable sacrifices in the context of a more worthy cause.



The whole point of bundling such philosophies together, is that they are the talking points of many of the tech elites of our time. From Sam altman CEO of CloseAI to Elon Musk. But not only from the people of the indistry but also influential academics like Nick Bostrom.
And such bundle produces a technopolitical project, that asserts the necessity of focusing research and ressources into the further development of machines, at all costs.
Nevertheless, the ideas of Emile P. Torres and Timnit Gebru, have received some criticism, in the sense that their view of such philosophies resembles a conspiracy theory. I need to incorparate some alternative points of view in this talk, otherwise it looks like I am biased *blink blink*, and as you all know we researcher have to be objective [sartcastic laughter]. In their piece for Medium Eli Sennesh and James J. Huges, a PhD candidate, and the head of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, have written a piece identifying the work of the aforementioned authors, Gebru and Torres, as a form of conspiracy theory. James H. Hughes in his piece also takes a look at all the philosophies bundled in the in the TESCREAL and with minor criticism sees them as an asset for a leftist futurism.
Their vision for a leftist futurism boils down to two paragraph that denounce right wing billionaires, and that harshly criticizing TESCREAL is a form of reactionary nostalgia, for stalinism and keynesian economics.
And this is often the case when technology is criticized, who disagrees with technological advancement is a backward looking person who wants to get back to the Stone Age. Furthermore, even accepting their position, one can easily see how such philosophies, rather than trying to solve social issues trough collective political action, they tend to prioritize individualistic approach to problems, as in the case of Affective Altruism, de facto justifying wealth accumulation as a good thing. But also in the case of trnashumanism and the hope for a post-human species, it is just an approach that reproduces ableist thropes of erasing disability, rather then building a society that can accomodate eterogeneous abilities. And the case of the other two philosophies, Singularitarianism and Longtermism, there is no justification for their ideas, they are just cringe to begin with.
Nevertheless what is an important take away from this critical piece, is their somewhat failed attemp to advocate for a "*leftist futurism*", putting emphasis on the word future. And this word is the token that bundles up all the aforementioned, and not mentioned, philosophies. So to say to look at the future as something that can be shaped, constructed and designed from now employing technology as the main tool.
And I guess now it is really the moment for me to bring all of those pieces together, and in respect to the topic of this conference, to connect magic, design and technology.

As I already mentioned the thread that connects those philosophies is the white gaze toward the future, and the way in which technology and its development converge towards it. One aspect to keep in mind, that is also apparent in the affective altruist philosophy is this notion of technology as being an autonomous force, something that can't be controlled by humanity. The ways in which this idea is instilled in all of us can be read in the writings of Langdon Winner, were he criticizes this idea of technology as an autonomous, almost natural force. An example is the case of the atomic bomb and the moral and ethical dilemmas that afflicted Oppenheimer, after the US decided that it would be a good idea to obliterate roughly 200.000 japanese citizens. When the scientist expressed his discontent about his discovery, a prompt response came: if it was not you, someone else would have inveted it. Such rethoric permeates the whole tech industry, if it was not you, than it would have been someone else, technological advancement can't be stopped. And while there might be some truth to that, it is also true that without Oppenheimer, the development of such a bomb would have taken more time, and we would have saved 200.000 lives. Furthermore, outside of wartime, such a technology would have been studied with more ethical frmework, and maybe banned or dismissed its production. This is just to say that politics and context matter a lot when governments decide where to invest their research funds. Furthermore, also Dirnstein discusses the autonomous nature of technology, specially in regards to genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics, in a critical way:

> Technological progress has long structured Euro-American identity, and it functions as a prop for a muted form of social Darwinism-either "might makes right," or "survival of the fittest." Here is the techno-cultural matrix: progress, religion, whiteness, modernity, masculinity, the future.

Furthermore:

> [treating] technology as an "autonomous" aspect of cultural production illuminating the road to a utopian future that will not require social or political change

Dirnstein contribution highlights the gendered and racial qualities that are intrisic to the idea of autonomous technology. Specially because the only technology that is autonomous is the one developed within the western institutions of technology.
TESCREAList therefore, propose, philosophies that might at a first glance might look attractive, because they propose to work for the betterment of human life. Nevertheless, their approach rather than offer socio-techno-political solutions for the betterment of coming years and catastrophes, they just offer a ditorted view of a possible future. Such practice of prediciting the future, in my view could termed as magical, to rephrase Dirnstein, "white magic", where TESCREAL ideologies function as a techno-political crystal ball to see the future, that can be designed from the present. And this form of design is the one that operates similarly to how colonial and imperialist forces dispossess land from indigenous people. Because such philosophy adopts forms of hierachy in which some forms of life are more expendable than the other, to the point that the transhumanist project should take over the whole humanity, one step at the time from the less desirable to the white western population. Thus TESCREAL vision of the future is a way to occupy it with the imaginary of a white transhuman species free to occupy and colonize outer space.



## 3.  Ludd meets Simondon

In his work "On the mode of Existence of technical object" Simondon spends quite some time describing the passage from manual labour to technical objects.
He describes this as the result of the dissoulution of slave labout in Europe during the renaissance, and the study of mechanical physics done by Reneé Descartes. To do so he uses a lot of dichotomies to illustrate the separation of  knowledge and ability, operation and intellect, craftsman and engineer, dominated and dominating.

> the craftsman will be like a magician, and his knowlcdge will be operational rather than intellectual; it will be an ability rather than a knowing; by its very nature, it will be a secret for others, because it will be a secret for himsclf, for his own consciousness.

The magician in this case, the craftsamn, reminds me of the worker in the british textile factories, that while crushing textile machinery was chanting about ned ludd. Termed luddites craftmans from the incipit of the industrial era, decided that the only way to defend their livelihood was to destroy the technologies that was taking it away for the profit of few industrialists.

I want to conclude with the summoning of this two spirits, to offer a starting point for reflection: is it worth continuing with this trajectory where technology = future, or is it time to change this direction and point it towards and present and perhaps also the past?























To conclude this lecture, I would like to tell you my stance in regard to technology at the moment, and how I practice magic by summoning ancient ghosts.
Furthermore, I titled this part what do I do, in order to avoid the patronising, what should WE do, but nevertheless I will use this point of advantage, to maybe influence a bit you on your practice.
I have been working with technology, specifically programming, for 8 years now, I have the privilege to work as a researcher at the institute of experimental design and media cultures in Basel, as well as working with a friend in our own web design studio. I think I always have loved technology and I usually think of it in a positive way, at least the technology I surround myself with: computers and synthesizers. Nevertheless, this does not mean that blindly love technology in a way that I can't see its shortcomings. And I also do not agree with the idea that technology is neutral, I mean a gun is built to kill, this what it does, a camera is built to surveil, and this is what it does. Technology is inherently political and reflects the politics of the institution where such machines are built.
Therefore, lately I started to practice some magic rituals: the summoning of the Spirit of Ned Ludd. The latter is a spirit who never really inhabited any human body but its action were chanted by the revolutionaries who were destroying machinery in the british textile factories. Termed Luddites such reactionaries became synonym with total disdain for technology, while in truth their action were motivated towards dismantling a technology who reduced their livelihood to accept minimum wage to the the profit of factory owners.
A more nuanced look to this people gave me the possibility to look at the technology from another angle, so to say, what are the outcomes of technology, and to the benefit of whom. And it is often the case that in this industrial society, technological development is made to cut cost to increase surplus for factory owners, shareholders and so on.
Similarly to how the luddites were doing in the XIX century I also find myself questioning the techno-politics of the genesis of certain technologies. Back then it was clear that the development of certain machinery was done solely for the reason of wealth accumulation. And similarly today the promise of heaven on earth trought un-regulated technology development, just hides the greedy nature of capitalist accumulation for the few.
Therefore lately in my practice I tend to summon the spirit of Ned Ludd to guide me in producing artistic or designerly artifacts that subvert technology on its head. And here I go back to my Fisiognomic Horoscope, an art piece devoted to spread criticism toward face recognition systems. But also to my PhD in which I subvert youtube recommeder system data collection to produce noise and breakcore, while poisoning the data I submit to them. Furthermore what is important to me in my practice when tackling technology criticism is to add playfulness to my projects, not to trivialize the seriousness of the topics investigated, but rather to make them fun and engaging for the audience.
