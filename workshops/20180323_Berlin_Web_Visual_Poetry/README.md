# WEB VISUAL POETRY WORKSHOP

## What will we do?

The aim of the workshop is to introduce you to programming. We will cover the basic elements to build an interactive website with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). 

With this tool we will be able transform a webpage into our canvas and with few line of code we will make it colorful and interactive.

As inspiration I suggest to take the websites made by [Rafël Rozeandaal](https://www.newrafael.com/websites/)

We will cover those topics:

0. Syntax `() [] {} , ;` 

1. variables `let something = be something`

2. basic shapes

   ```javascript
   rect(so far from the left, so below the top, so large, and so tall)//a rect
   ellipse(same, same, rather thin, but tall)//an ellipse
   ```

   ​

3. if statements

   ```javascript
   if(I am Something){
       change me into something else
   }else{
       let me be what I am
   }
   ```

4. for loops

   ```javascript
   for(let me start here; and end here; increasing by something){
       do this so many times
   }
   ```

5. mouse event

   ```javascript
   mouseX 
   mouseY
   function mouseClicked(){
       who clicked me?
   }

   function mouseDragged(){
       who clicks and moves me?
   }
   ```

   ​

## Dependencies a.k.a. what you need to download

1. A good code editor. I sugest either [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Higly Recommended),  [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)
2. I know everybody hates it but we will use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as browser. It has good built in console for debugging, so make sure to download it.
3. Please download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/de/) the free version of it.
4. Also make sure to download this blankExample.zip [here](https://github.com/yanoteaching/SFAC/blob/master/classes/blankExample.zip) by either clicking __download__ or __view raw__
